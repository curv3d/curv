TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation
using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations,
while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)
communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy
computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile
device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers
and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine
Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine
learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough
to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

Magenta is a project use to use TensorFlow for procedurally generated
art and music, which seems to align with the goals of Curv.
