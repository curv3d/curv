Numbers
=======
The `Num` data type is part of the modelling language, It is a single unified
number type that contains all Curv numbers, with consistent laws of arithmetic.
Currently I use 64 bit IEEE floats, modulo NaN. There are some changes I want,
to make Num numbers behave more like mathematical numbers.
 * Get rid of negative zero.
 * Add big integers.

I would like to add Int and Nat as subsets of Num (to the modelling language).
* `inf` is not an Int. It's a weird indefinite number where `frac inf` fails
  and `inf - inf` fails. It's too indefinite to definitely be an integer
  or to definitely be a noninteger. We could say that `frac n==0` for all Int.
* Is -0 an Int? No good answer; getting rid of -0 solves the problem.
  Note `frac(-0) === -0`, and -0 is a weird indefinite number that is like a
  quantum superposition of 0 and a negative infinitesimal. So probably not Int.

SubCurv will be getting a set of 'machine' number types. The interpreter
can run native SubCurv functions on the CPU or GPU and read values back.
Thus I need a mapping between these numbers and Num. Ideally,
 * Num contains all of the machine numbers, across all m.num.types.
   Problem: 2^64-1, if I support nat64. Solved by big integers.
   Problem: -0 in a float32 variable.
    * Include -0 in Num, as I do now.
    * Convert to 0 if the value is boxed?
   Problem: NaN as a float32 element of a large data structure.
    * On the CPU, trap on NaN when value is computed?
    * Fail if the value is boxed when element is accessed?
 * Machine numbers obey the same laws as Num numbers.
   This isn't possible if I support both int32 and float32, which I must.

Real Number Systems
-------------------
Here are some alternative designs for a real number system, for use by a
programming language. The questions are: do we extend the real numbers with
signed zero, one or more infinities, and the NaN value?

 1. IEEE floats. It has +0 and -0, +inf and -inf, and NaN.
    Used by: most popular languages.
 2. Projective Reals. It has a single 0, a single infinity, no NaN.
    This is a well defined mathematical structure,
    independent of programming languages.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line
    Used by: the proposed Posit floating point standard.
    Used by: Mathematica (Wolfram language). 1/0 is ComplexInfinity.
      rationale: http://oeis.org/wiki/Division_by_zero
    But Mathematica also uses Affine infinity: log(0) is -Infinity.
    * Kahan, in a retrospective of IEEE floats, said that signed zero is
      "a pain in the ass", and that the projective reals are the preferred
      design. However, if you want your system to have signed infinity,
      then you also need signed zero.
 3. Affine Reals. The real numbers extended with +inf and -inf.
    (A single 0, no NaN.) This is a well defined mathematical structure,
    independent of programming languages.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line
    * Used by the Wolfram language in Mathematica.
      Mathematica provides both projective and affine infinities, and math
      operations return one or the other kind of infinity, whichever makes
      most sense in that situation.
    * Used by J. Except that 0/0 is 0, instead of an error.
      (The actual J expression is '0%0'.)
    * Used by Shakti K: signed infinity, unique zero. Except that 0/0 is NaN.
 4. Real numbers with no extensions. (A single zero, no infinities, no NaN.)
    Used by:
    * Python
    * Pyret
    * Dyalog APL
    * Perl

There are design tradeoffs between performance (given the existence of IEEE
float hardware) and good mathematical behaviour. Of these choices, IEEE floats
have the best performance and the worst mathematical behaviour.

For an end-user programming language with the fewest surprises, I think that
#4 (no extensions) is the best general choice.

Negative zero and NaN cause severe language design and usability problems.
Both violate the laws I want for the == operator:
  x==x, x==y implies y==x, x==y && y==z implies x==z, x==y implies f(x)==f(y)
I do not want these numbers in Curv.

The Projective Reals also cause a problem with relational operators.
All Real numbers obey the law of trichotomy: every number is 0, negative
or positive. And the Real numbers are a total order. The Projective Reals
break this, because infinity is not ordered relative to the finite reals.
This messes with your intuition of how numbers work and can break conditional
logic that otherwise works for real numbers. Thus,
* 'x < y' fails if x or y is infinite
* 'abs x' fails if x is infinite
* 'max[x,y]' fails if x or y is infinite
* 'sort xs' fails if xs (a list of numbers) contains infinity

However, signed infinity has turned out to be quite useful for 3D graphics:
* In Curv when working with infinite shapes.
* A ray-tracing algorithm that uses signed infinity:
  https://tavianator.com/2011/ray_box.html

My experience is that the existence of infinite numbers
in Curv is surprising to users (and so are infinite shapes). Despite this,
I prefer to keep signed infinity, just because infinite shapes are so useful.

Which of these number systems is best from a purely mathematical perspective?
Why extend the reals at all?

If you go back in history, then in the beginning were the counting numbers
1, 2, 3, ... Some nonhuman animals have an ability to count, so we may have
had counting numbers during the protolanguage phase, before modern human
language was fully developed. Once we had agriculture, we started creating
permanent buildings and cities. Fractional positive numbers were needed for
measuring distances, for architecture. The ancient Greeks had the positive
counting numbers and fractional numbers, and they had the arithmetic operations
(+, -, *, /), but they did not have the concept of zero as a number, and they
did not have negative numbers. This was the number system of early civilization,
B.C.E.

This early number system was extended by mathematicians during the C.E. era
to add zero and negative numbers because it makes more things work, without
breaking anything that already worked. Eg, subtraction is now closed: if x
and y are numbers, then x-y is also a number. Without zero, x-x is undefined.
Without zero and negative numbers, x-y is only defined if x > y.
These extensions mean:
 * If you are describing an algorithm, then there is less conditional code
   you need to write to avoid the "holes" in the number system.
   (The ancient Babylonians had algorithms, long before Greek mathematicians
   like Pythagorus and Euclid. The limitations of their number system made
   their algorithms more complicated.)
   Today, all of the arithmetic operations are closed, except division, so even
   in the modern era, we still need to remember that in x/y, y cannot be zero.
 * There are more algebraic laws that work, which you can use for reasoning
   about code.
 * The additional numbers that we added are useful. Eg, negative numbers are
   useful for accounting (profit and loss).

If we extend the real numbers with infinity, then we gain some useful new
laws that simplify algorithms and assist algebraic reasoning. Division by zero
is now defined (except for 0/0). But this time, we break some laws of arithmetic
that previously worked. Eg, + and * are no longer closed. Also, there are
two ways to make this extension: the Projective Reals have one infinity,
the Affine Reals have two infinities (positive and negative). Unlike
the previous extensions (fractional numbers, zero, negative numbers), we have
two alternatives, and neither is a clear winner over the other. This is why
infinity isn't a standard part of arithmetic as taught in elementary schools.

I want to use the Affine Reals, because the addition of signed infinity is
beneficial to Curv, but the provision of signed infinity by float hardware
is also a consideration. Can I prove to myself that the benefits of this
extension outweigh the drawbacks?
* For both Projective R and Affine R, all laws of arithmetic that are valid
  for R are also valid for extended R, whenever all of the occurring expressions
  are defined. (Because in extended R, many formerly closed numeric operations
  are no longer closed.)
* Affine R is still a total ordering: a < b is defined for all numbers.
  Projective R is not a total ordering: a < b is undefined if either argument
  is infinity. This is actually a significant issue for reasoning about
  conditional logic.

I mentioned that one goal of an extension is to not break anything that
previously worked. The Projective Reals do break some existing laws of
arithmetic.
* The single infinity value is neither less or greater than the existing
  finite numbers, so x > infinity and x < infinity are not defined, so
  the < and > relations are no longer defined over all numbers.

So I'll ignore Kahan's advice, and use the Affine Reals:
reals extended with signed infinity.

Negative Zero
-------------
Negative zero causes problems, since it makes no sense in conventional math.
-0 sometimes behaves like a very small negative number, and sometimes
behaves like 0, but it's ad hoc, there is no consistent mathematical
interpretation, even within a single primitive operation.

I am contemplating making a distinction between a==b (equality)
and a===b (equivalence). The only reason for two operators
is that 0==-0 but 0!==-0. Eliminate -0 and I don't need two operators.

Curv now has numeral patterns.
* Should the pattern `0` match both 0 and -0? Currently it does.
* Should the pattern `-0` match both 0 and -0? Currently it does.
  This seems messed up.
* If I get rid of -0, the problem goes away.
* Alternatively, I add the === operator, and I add `==x` and `===x`
  patterns. The `0` pattern uses ==, matches 0 and -0, which works
  for matching integers, or for matching the result of 'sign'.
  The pattern `-0` is an error, and the message suggests you use `=== -0`
  instead.

`sign(-0)` is -0, compatible with Julia. This preserves the important
identity `abs n * sign n === n`, while also making `sign n == 0`
true for both zeroes. But it's ad hoc:
 * If -0 is a small negative number, we expect `sign(-0)` to be -1.
   If -0 is zero, we expect `sign(-0) to be 0.
   But both these interpretations of -0 break identities we care about.
 * GLSL sign(-0.0) returns 0.0, and Curv's sign is mostly compatible.

floor,ceil,trunc,round all map -0 to -0. Compatible with Julia and C.
No idea why, but see `sign`.

If I keep -0, then there's reason to add copysign and signbit from IEEE,
just so you can write code that doesn't break when given a -0 argument.
(I might need these in SubCurv anyway, for porting numeric algorithms?)

Even if I remove -0 from the modelling language (remove it from Num),
I will still have it in SubCurv, and primitive numeric operations will
still need to handle it correctly (compatibly with other languages).
* `sign(-0)` is -0; this makes no sense in conventional math, but is compatible
  with the identity `abs n * sign n === n`.
* There will be a type Int, which is a subset of Num containing only integers.
  Is -0 an Int?
  * We could say `frac i` is 0 for all Ints. Currently `frac(-0)` is 0, but 
    if -0 is a negative infinitesimal, then `frac(-0)` should be `-0`,
    in which case -0 is not an integer.
  * No because -0 is a float that represents a very small negative number
    that underflowed. It isn't an integer, it isn't zero.
  * Yes because otherwise, `-` is not closed over the Ints.

If I drop -0, then that perturbs all of the float numeric primitives.
How do I get a confluent number system with lots of useful identities?
To what extent do I gain and lose useful identities? Is it a net improvement?

Languages that don't have -0:
* Pyret (both exact and floating point numbers). Also no infinity.
* K9 doesn't have -0. It has +inf, -inf and nan (0w, -0w, 0n).
  K doesn't have a fully unified number type (floats and ints diverge at large
  values).
* Dyalog APL lacks -0 and infinity. Division by 0 is an error.
* Mathematica lacks -0. It has Infinity and -Infinity. 0/0 is undef.

If I do this, I keep using the IEEE 64 bit floats but I drop -0, converting it
to 0 when it is computed by native operations.

My main concern is compatibility between Curv and SubCurv,
ability to test SubCurv code in the Curv REPL.

Big Integers
------------
This feature adds support for arbitrary precision exact integer arithmetic,
*without* splitting the POD Number type into two distinct types with conflicting
rules for integer arithmetic.

Is this needed in Curv? The initial idea was to provide operations for
converting arbitrary bit strings to and from integers, which was inspired
by writing the Noise library. A possible future requirement for SubCurv,
or for interoperability with external data and APIs, is to support 64 bit
integer types, so I'd need contiguous integers up to 2^64-1. More generally,
many dynamically typed languages have bigints, and they are nice to have
for recreational programming.

Proposed: a new representation of numbers that fuses the IEEE float64 numbers
with multiprecision integers. There is only one kind of integer:
2 and 2.0 are the same, have the same semantics, even if there may be
two internal int representations. All of the floats whose magnitude >= 2^52
are fused with the integers, except the infinities. And these integers map to
exact integer results when used with operations that support exact integer
semantics.

Floats whose magnitude > 2^53 are mapped to integers with more significant
figures than the standard Curv printed float representation, and they are
printed as integers, with no decimal point or exponent. This is a longer
printed representation, potentially much longer, than printed floats. Eg,
    >>> 2^100
    1.2676506002282294e30               -- curv 0.4
    1267650600228229401496703205376     -- Numbers

The worst case is the largest non-infinite float64:
    curv> 2^1023
    8.98846567431158e307
    89884656743115795386465259539451236680898848947115328636715040578866\
    33790275048156635423866120376801056005693993569667882939488440720831\
    12464237153197370621888839467124327426381511098006230470597265414760\
    42502884419075341171231440736956555270413618581675255342293149119973\
    622969239858152417678164812112068608

Operations that may return non-float (large integer) results:
  a + b,  a - b,  a * b,  -a,  abs a
  integer quotient and remainder, ceil/floor/trunc versions
  a^b -- semantics? doesn't always return an integer

Other operations, eg trigonometry, convert Numbers to floats first.

Fast + implementation:
If both arguments are float, then perform float addition. Then, if inexact
flag is set, and both arguments are integral, then redo using bigints.
Use portable C++11 <fcenv> functions. Avoid assembly language.
