Modules are code, Records are data
==================================
In this proposal, Module and Record are disjoint types.

A module is a set of recursive definitions.
A record is a mapping from names (symbols) to values.

An anonymous module literal is {{defns}}, with {{ }} as the empty module.
Directory syntax also creates a module.
A record literal is {field-generator}, with {} as the empty record.
The `f x: x + 1` field syntax is going away.

Modules can be defined recursively (mutual recursion between modules).
Records are finite trees, they cannot be recursively defined.

A module can be branded. Individual members of a module can be branded.
Directory modules are always branded, with the root brand being a `file`
expression.

A module can carry a docstring.
Module members can have doc strings (whether or not they are branded).
In directory syntax, a `README` file contains the docstring.

A module value *should* contain axioms that formally describe the semantics
of its members. Initially, docstrings can describe the semantics informally.
The role of `test` definitions in a module should be further explored.
Brands and theories are ways of formally indicating module semantics.

A branded module prints as a brand.
An unbranded module prints as a module literal (reproducing the original
source code, and showing dependencies between members). Thus the original
code that generated the module is preserved in the value.
A record prints as a record literal, with name/value pairs.

Modules and records both support dot notation:
A.x selects member/field x of module/record A.

Module members are not assignable using `:=`.
Records are updatable data structures that support Index values:
R.[#x] is a locative.
Record fields are individually and independently updatable.

Modules have two magic member names (call and T):
 * If a module has a `call` member that is a function,
   then it can be called as a function and matches `is Func`.
 * If a module has a `T` member that is a type,
   then it can be used as a type and matches `is Type`.

Two branded modules are equal if they have the same brand.
Two unbranded modules are equal if the module literal has the same source code
location, and the values of nonlocal variable references are equal.
Two records are equal if they are the same mapping from keys to elements.

With the Object proposal, a module can contain object bindings.

You can explicitly convert a Module to a Record (with loss of metadata).
 * And possible failure if the module contains object bindings.
You can explicitly convert a Record to a Module (an isomorphism).

Modules belong to the software engineering dialect.
Records belong to the creative coding dialect.

Issues
------
* Can I use `indices M` or `M.[#foo]` without converting to a record?
  * Yes, but assignment of M.[#foo] panics, same as assignment of `M.foo`.
    It's good that a.foo and a.[#foo] are equivalent in all contexts.
  * A bad alternative is: M is converted to a record, with loss of metadata.
    Which violates the axiom that record fields are independently updatable
    (no spooky action...).
* Is `... M` legal? Yes.
* Is `include R` legal? Sure why not. Records and modules are interchangeable
  everywhere it makes sense.
* Metaprogramming for modules.
* What about the planned idiom for selective module import,
    include M >> get{#foo,#bar}
  I guess this works (no definition metadata is preserved, appropriately).
  It can't work for importing object bindings.
* If a module includes another module with metadata on its members (docstrings
  or brands), is any of that metadata preserved in the outer module?

Critique and Rationale
----------------------
I didn't want to do this, because it introduces two subtly incompatible ways
of expressing the same thing, it forces you to make a choice between similar
but not identical concepts. Should I write {a:1} or {{a=1}}?

But consider:
 * We already had two record syntaxes in Curv 0.5, and it was always unclear
   whether you should write make_shape{dist:...} or make_shape{dist=...}.
 * The choice between records and modules should be clearer in Curv.next,
   in the idioms and APIs that take record/module arguments.
 * The creative coding dialect is simplified, because records are simpler.
 * The software engineering dialect gets more powerful module features
   that are important for writing abstract, easy to use modules.

I considered defining Module as a subtype of Record, so {a:1} == {{a=1}}.
The goal was to preserve the same kind of simplicity and purity I have with
List values, where tuples, arrays and strings are not disjoint kinds of values,
they are all just lists. But that got messy and complicated. Maybe more
complicated than disjoint types.
 * A module containing pure data, with no code values, doc strings, or objects,
   is equal to a structurally equivalent record containing the same name=>data
   mapping.
 * What about {call:sin} == {{call=sin}}? These are not equal unless
   records have magic member names.
 * Pure-data modules therefore print the same as records. But how, using
   field notation? And if you make certain changes to a module, then it
   switches to print using definition notation?
 * If I add a docstring to a member of a pure-data module, then does equality
   compare docstrings, or does the module change phase and use code equality?
 * Modules use code equality for branded members.
 * Pure-data modules must support assignment. What happens if other features
   are used in the module?
 * If you reassign a module's members, what happens to the module's axioms
   (however they are being represented)?
 * In a non-pure-data module, maybe field assignment will:
    1. panic.
    2. discard all module metadata and convert the value to a record prior to
       doing the assignment. Modifying one field has the side effect of
       modifying other fields (by killing their metadata).
   Why is this tricky? Consider an ordinary looking module member `g=f`,
   where `f` is a branded member of the same module. Rebranding the module
   will change the value of `g`, even though `g` itself is not directly branded.
   So this dependency of `g` on `f` is part of the module's identity.
   What if I reassign `g`?
    3. Maybe `g` is converted to a pure-data field of the module, losing its
       dependency relation to `f`, and prints as a field?
 * So now I'm getting this idea of hybrid record-module chimeras, where some
   bindings are members and some bindings are fields.

Implementation
--------------
How is this implemented? It seems that a module is represented by a thunk
that contains code and an environment (like a closure).
* Lazy evaluation, like directory modules?
* Modules can be defined recursively?
* This environment duplicates data in all the function closures.
  Maybe there should just be one shared environment.
