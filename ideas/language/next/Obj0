Object 0: An initial subset of the TUPL 'Object' proposal
=========================================================
This is a subset of the TUPL object proposal where:
* All objects are mutable local variables. Object phrases are locatives.
* Modules do not contain object bindings.

Proposed for addition to Curv.
A deep dive into this subset will expose any design & implementation issues.

Compound Locatives
------------------
[loc1, loc2]
{a: loc2, b: loc2}

Procedures
----------
proc <locative-pattern> is <statement>
proc <locative-pattern> -> <statement>
   A procedure can be called as a function: the argument is assigned to a
   local variable, which is mutated by statement, then the variable contains
   the function call result.
   Or, a procedure P be invoked as `loca!P` to mutate a locative.

`locative!op` is a statement.
   op is a function mapping state -> newstate, or a procedure.

proc <locative-pattern> is begin <statements> in <expression>
proc <locative-pattern> -> begin <statements> in <expression>
proc <locative-pattern> -> (<statements>; <expression>)
   Query procedure, effectively a query function in imperative form.

`locative?op` is an impure expression.
   where op is a query proc or a query func mapping state->[newstate,result].
   Impure expressions are legal in a limited set of contexts:
    * as a REPL command.
    * as the right side of a LOCAL definition.
    * as a <generator> phrase, if locative is in scope for assignment.
   These contexts uphold the principle that at most one locative gets mutated
   per statement.

Rationale for `loc?op` syntax. Suppose we use
    <pattern> <- <locative> ! op
or
    let <pattern> = <locative> ! op
instead. (First syntax inspired by Haskell do exprs and F# sequence exprs.)
Then the meaning of loc!F is context sensitive: which part of the result of
the function call F(loc) is assigned back to the locative depends on whether
loc!F appears in expression or statement context. If loc!F appears in a
weak context (a REPL command) then what happens?

Can `loc?op` return a locative?
Yes, for constructing a new object (not in Object0).
Otherwise we would be returning a borrowed locative (like a lens call).
And there is only one object argument, so we are mutating and lensing
the same object. Too weird to support as a special case. Leave it out.

Both kinds of procedure answer true to `is_func` (and is_primitive_func?).

Lenses
------
A functional abstraction over a locative could have these forms:
    f <expr> -> <loc>
        Impossible.
    f <loc> -> <expr>
        This function can do nothing but read the locative's state.
        Useful in TUPL. In Object0, just use a regular function.
    f <loc> -> <loc>
        In Object0, f must be a lens.
So we need user-defined lens values.

Generators
----------
To abstract over generators, we need a value representation of a generator.
The elements of a generator phrase append values to an implicit list object.
Let's represent a generator by a procedure that takes this object as argument.

Reify a generator phrase (a,b,c) as a procedure value:
    #(a,b,c)

`!proc` is a generator that mutates the implicit list object using a procedure.
Aka: invoke a generator value.

Hence `obj!#(generator)` is a statement that executes the given generator in
a context where the implicit object is `obj`. Nothing is returned.

`?proc` is an impure expression that applies `proc` to the implicit list object.

So now, with `!proc` and `?proc` and the implicit object,
we have the beginnings of "generalized imperative programming",
kind of like Haskell monads or F# sequence expressions.

Debug Actions
-------------
`print "Hello world"` is an identity function that prints to the console
as a side effect.

`foo!print "Hello world"` is a statement -- the object `foo` is ignored.

`!print "Hello world"` is the usual syntax for invoking `print`.
It works in any statement context. Within a `begin <statements> in <expr>`,
the "implicit list object" is the locative `[]`.

[..., !print x, ...] -- insert a debug print statement into a list.
The `!` syntax makes clear that we aren't inserting the result of the function
call `print x` as a list element.

`... >> print x >> ...` -- insert a debug print statement into a pipeline.
`print x` is an identity function with a debug side effect.

`print` is an ordinary value (no longer magic syntax).
We can now more easily abstract over debug actions.
The `exec` command is replaced by `!`.
#(...) can be used to construct a compound unevaluated debug action.

Error Handling
--------------
I want to provide a high level mechanism for imperative error handling.
It fits into "generalized imperative programming" somehow.

Applications
------------
"generalized imperative programming" is just as weird and abstract as monads
and sequence expressions. It won't be familiar: the full exposition needs to
reside in a low level tier of the language hierarchy. It needs to be justified
as a tool for creating easy-to-use high level library abstractions.

To start with, the killer apps are "debug actions" and "procedural union".

proc_union #(for (i in list) f i)
    The argument is an unevaluated shape generator, which is executed in the
    GPU. I.e., the `for` loop is part of the generated distance function.
    By contrast, `union[for (i in list) f i]` generates a list of shapes,
    throwing away the structure of the for loop, then unions them.

Haskell has "lazy data structures", a key feature.
You can think of them as a kind of "procedural data", where embedded code
is executed while accessing the data.
But they are impossible to implement on a GPU due to memoization.
Generator values are another kind of procedural data, another kind of "lazy
list" which are more directly applicable to GPU programming.
