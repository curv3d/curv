Binary Operators
================
How are they encoded? As `f[a,b]` or as `f a b`?

Many common binary operators are monoids, and are encoded as reduction
operators taking a list of arguments, so `f[a,b]` is the special case
for two arguments. This is to avoid the code duplication of `max`
and `maximum` found in Haskell.

Because of this, infix operators like
    a `max` b
are an alt syntax for pair-encoded binary operators:
    max[a,b]

The canonical way to write a function with 2 or 3 arguments is 'f x y'.
So for binary operators where the two arguments don't have the same type
or don't play the same role, it's more idiomatic to use Currying.
 * Eg, I have proposed
     log b n
   because the argument order directly corresponds to math notation $log_b n$.
 * Eg, `shiftl n bstr`.
 * Eg, `lerp [a,b] i` inspired by d3-interpolate.
 * Eg, `mod m a`?

Then we can use partial applications as combinator arguments, eg:
    log 2
    shiftl 4
    lerp [a,b]
    frac = mod 1

BUT if I use Currying then the proposed ~ operator won't work for iterating
over the first argument.

So define another combinator?
    uncurry f [a,b] = f a b
then use
    a `uncurry shiftl`~ b
Note `uncurry` is in Haskell, so this is a standard name.

BUT if I use Currying then the amap/smap APIs don't work.
So I need curry and pair versions.
    amap f  -- unary
    amap2 f -- curried binary
    amapl f -- list argument

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a theme here. Two ways to do it, creating cognitive load,
because there's a decision to make when defining a binary operator.

In Haskell, the choice is always to Curry.
In mainstream languages, the choice is always to pair.

Although: Haskell has reduction functions like sum and maximum.
And mainstream languages have variadic functions.

An n-ary function should take a list argument if it is a reduction function
or an algebraic binary magma function. Otherwise curried.
