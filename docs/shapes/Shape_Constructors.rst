Platonic Solids
  There are five definitions:

  * ``tetrahedron``
  * ``cube``
  * ``octahedron``
  * ``dodecahedron``
  * ``icosahedron``

  Each Platonic solid ``S`` has the following API:

  * ``S d`` constructs the solid centred on the origin whose
    inscribed sphere has diameter ``d``.
  * ``S`` is a prototypical instance of the solid, equivalent to ``S 2``
    (i.e., the inscribed sphere is the unit sphere with radius 1).
  * ``S.circumratio`` is the ratio of the circumradius over the inradius
    (a value > 1).
    For example,

    * ``S(d/S.circumratio)`` constructs an instance of S
      whose circumscribed sphere has diameter ``d``.
    * ``sphere(d*cube.circumratio)`` constructs a sphere that circumscribes
      a cube of height d.

  * ``S.mitred d`` constructs an instance of S with a mitred distance field.
  * ``S.exact d`` constructs an instance of S with an exact distance field.

  TODO:

  * ``octahedron.exact``

  * ``icosahedron.exact``

``half_space ...``
  A half-space is an infinite 3D shape consisting of all points on one side
  of an infinite plane that subdivides 3-space. The points in the plane
  are included. Exact distance field.

  ``half_space {d, normal: n}``

    whose boundary plane is distance ``d`` from the origin.

    from above and outside of the half-space.

``gyroid``
  The gyroid surface (`<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid>`_)
  is an infinite, labyrinthine, curved surface that is popular in 3D printed art.
  
  The gyroid surface partitions 3D space into two mirror image but congruent subspaces.
  The Curv ``gyroid`` constructor is one of these subspaces.
  You can get the other subspace using ``complement gyroid``,
  and you can get the gyroid surface using ``shell 0 gyroid``.
  
  TODO: distance field is bad.

Polydimensional Shapes
----------------------
``nothing``
  A special shape, classified as both 2D and 3D,
  that contains no geometric points.
  It's the identity element for the ``union`` operation.

``everything``

  that contains all geometric points.
  It's the identity element for the ``intersection`` operation.
