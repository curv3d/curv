TODO:
 - SC_Type: clean up API to make it more regular.
 - SC_Type: make it fully abstract (all data members private)
 - Reimplement SC_Type using Type values (Num,Bool,List)
 * SC_Compiler denotes a GLSL or C++ program that is under construction.
   It accumulates code (top level definitions) which are output all at once.
   Type definitions (such as Tuple types) must be output before functions.
 * Change the representation of arrays to a struct containing a '_' member.
   struct array_232 { float _[42]; }; This allows arrays to be nested, passed
   as first class values, returned as first class results, in GLSL and in C++.
 * Eliminate the restriction on the number of dimensions of an array in SubCurv.
 * Add a Tuple type to SC_Type.
   List values and List_Exprs are given this type by the SC compiler.
 * Function call arguments may be Tuples.
 * Add a Struct type to SC_Type.
 * Replace Function::sc_call_expr() with
     SC_Value Function::sc_call(SC_Value, SC_Frame&)
   There is no longer a need to convert List_Expr ops directly into
   function call parameter lists.

Required by: native `compose` function.

I don't currently have primitive functions supported by SubCurv that take
record, rather than tuple, arguments (named rather than positional arguments).
But if I did, they would need sc_call_expr() in order to work around the
absence of an SC Record type. I should therefore add an SC Struct type as
well, or at least make it trivial to add one later.

WGSL numeric types
------------------
scalar: bool, i32, u32, f32
vector: vecN<T>: N in 2..4, T is scalar
matrix: matNxM: N, M in 2..4, base type is f32

As a group, call these the SVM types (scalar, vector, matrix).

struc and plex
--------------
replacing "struc" with "plex".
A plex is:
    a Bool, Num, Bool32
    a vec[2-4] of Bool, Num, Bool32
    a mat[2-4] of Num
    a tuple
    a struct
A type is either a plex or an array of plex.
In GLSL/WGSL, a plex is not represented by an array type,
while an array of plex is represented by an array type.
Query functions:
    plex_rank(): 0 if a plex, >0 if an array of plex
    plex_base()
A bool_plex is: Bool, Bool32, or vec[2-4] of same.
A num_plex is: Num, vec[2-4] of Num, or mat[2-4] of Num.

We have: is_struc(). Is this the same thing as is_plex()?
Let's see.
 * Unary_Scalar_Prim (really a part of equal/unequal) uses is_struc()
   to validate arguments to equal(). Which can only return a bool-plex,
   since I don't support returning array values in SC right now.
   So valid arguments would be a scalar_plex or a struct (not a tuple).
 * Used to validate arguments to sc_struc_unify().
   Which is called to unify
     two num_plex types
     two arguments to 'equal'
   which in both cases are plexes.

add: is_scalar_plex
     is_tuple
     is_struct

SC_Type representation
----------------------
The simplest representation of an SC_Type is:
    Num | Bool | List N T | Tuple [T1,T2,...] | Struct {sym1:T1,...}

This is a subset of the type values in the Types proposal, so I will
represent these as Type : public Ref_Value.

I'll need a mapping from these types to GLSL types.
Eg, List 32 Bool => "uint", etc.
A "GLNum" is a GLSL scalar, vec or mat type: these are the types that
support numeric operations.
I can represent all of the GLNum types in 8 bits.
A curv::Type contains a glnum_ field which is either missing, or it means
the Type is also a GLNum.

I need a map from a Value to a principle type.
However, the value sets of List and Tuple overlap.
* Tuples can only be indexed with compile time values, while Lists can be
  indexed with run time values, so List should be preferred over Tuple in case
  of ambiguity. Eg, [1,2] has principle type List 2 Num.
* What is the principle type of []?
    List 0 T, for all types T
    Tuple[]
  The type of [] is special in that it cannot be indexed at all, either
  dynamically or statically. I think Tuple[] is a good choice.

Even though List 2 Num and Tuple[Num,Num] have the same value set, they are
different types because they have different APIs in SubCurv. Therefore they
print differently and compare unequal as type values.

SC_Value representation
-----------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------
Composite_Function needs to implement sc_call_expr or gyroid.curv won't compile.
This seems to require
    SC_Value Function::sc_call(SC_Value, SC_Frame&)
But I don't have that; instead I have
    SC_Value Function::sc_call_expr(Operation&, Phrase&, SC_Frame&)
I don't have a method to construct an Operation from an SC_Value.

The sc_call_expr() interface is currently required because a function
argument might be a tuple. I can't represent a tuple using an SC_Value.
So instead I check if an Operation is a List_Expr.

I could implement a tuple type for SC_Value.
 * It could be represented using GLSL 'struct' values.
   This does imply packing argument tuples into a struct when a function
   is to be called, something I currently avoid.
 * I could also represent a tuple as a collection of SC_Values.
   This is used as is when the tuple is used to provide the argument to
   a function call. In other contexts, it may be promoted to a struct value.
   (That's not consistent with the current SC_Value representation.)
 * What approach is forward compatible with the New_Core design?
