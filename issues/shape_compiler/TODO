Done:
* IR nodes have static phrase type
Next:
* Type values.
  * New type/module style core API replacing predicates and constructor
    functions with algebras. Eg, is_char/char => Char.
    * fix `is` to report error on first argument.
  * All Curv 0.5 SC types now have Curv type expressions.
    Print Curv type exprs in SC error messages.
  * Shape library predicates and constructors are updated.
* Replace SC_Value with IR nodes.
  * Migrate incrementally to new representation.
    Initially, SC_Value and Operation are interconvertible.
    SC_Frame now contains operations.
