Union Types in SubCurv
======================
This is post-MVP (of the new shape compiler).

Support union types in SubCurv, so that
    if (cond) Texpr else Eexpr
will compile when Texpr and Eexpr have disjoint SubCurv types.
The run-time representation is a tag, followed by data that is interpreted
relative to the tag.

The goal is to expand the subset of Curv supported by the shape compiler.
