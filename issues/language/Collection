This project adds generic operations on collections.
Prerequisite: Pairs

A Collection is a list or a record.

Curv 0.5 introduces some generic operations on collections:
    ... C
    C.[i]

This proposal provides additional generic operations on Collections,
consistent with the behaviour of the `...` operator.
This is the first phase of a project that will eventually yield
a fully specified Collection algebra and that will eventually support
the Generator Protocol.

All collections are ordered (see also Python 3.7 and Javascript ES).
Records are ordered alphabetically by field name.
This order is exposed by: the `...` operator, the `for` operator,
the `indices` function, and by conversion to a string.

count C
    number of elements in C

indices C
    An ordered list of the index values for the elements of C.
    You can use one this index values `i` in the context `C.[i]`.
alt name: keys. But keys returns a list of index values, so...

`fields` is deprecated.

defined(C.[i]) when C is a list.

for (pattern in C) ...
    If C is a list, then iterate over the elements.
    If C is a record, then iterate over key/value pairs (represented as pairs).

## Future Work

The Collection interface is not yet complete and coherent.
That work is deferred until I implement Algebraic Data Abstraction,
and create a fully specified algebraic Theory of collections.
For now, just implement high value operations.

Try to fully specify the semantics of the Collection API by writing
axioms or laws, solely in terms of Collection methods. Are there missing
methods I need to write all the axioms? Then add them.

The Collection interface will be a key part of the future Generator Protocol.

Methods that might be missing:

is_collection X
    true if X is a collection

clear C
    Construct a new empty instance of the datatype of C.
    The imperative form C!clear removes all elements from an existing
    collection and is a standard member of OOP Collection classes.
add E C
    Add one element to the end of C (for a record, overriding an existing
    member with the same field name).
append C1 C
    Add all of the elements of C1 to C, in order of C1.
    Note that C1 and C may have different collection datatypes,
    and the result has the same type as C.

Using clear/add/append we can write generic algorithms that create new
collections from existing collections.

See [[vm/Array_Rep]] for an efficient implementation of clear/add/append.
It's a growable list representation that behaves like std::vector in C++.

The Generator Protocol works by creating an empty collection variable C,
then calling `C!add E` if an expression generator evaluates to E,
and calling `C!append C1` if `... C1` is executed.

Not sure about these:

map F C
    Return a copy of C from which each element X is replaced by F X.
filter F C
    Copy of C from which elements X for which F X is false are removed.

`map` is weird because it can change key values in a record, and introduce
duplicate keys: remove duplicate keys (last one wins) or report error.

## Prior Art

Python:
   map and for consistently iterate over the keys of a dictionary.

Javascript:
   for (i in object) -- iterate over keys (enumerable properties) of an object
   for (i of iterable) -- elements of an Array, items of a Map,
        same as the 'for' in this proposal. Doesn't work an Object
        like {a:1,b:2} for historical reasons. 'Map' is fairly new and
        should have better designed semantics than Object which is a mess.
   myMap.forEach(function(value,key){...})
   no 'map' function over Maps or Objects.
   Javascript ES echoes my choice to iterate over key/elem record items.
