Roadmap for Index values
========================
records are indices
-------------------
According to [[ideas/language/next/Index]].

get, set
--------
add
    get Index Tree
    set Index NewVal Tree
deprecate
    amend, in favour of set

Rationale:
documentation will talk about the common idiom of getter and setter
functions. In Curv, an index `I` encapsulates both, and you use
    get I
    set I
to convert an index to a getter and setter.

make_index
----------
make_index {get: tree -> value_at_index, set: newval tree -> new_tree}

make_index returns an ADT instance (not POD data), which is distinct
from a record. Hence make_index does not prevent us from using records
as indices in the future.

This is a simple and basic API for defining custom index values in the
most common case. For some sophisticated indexes we need a richer API (later).
Goal: to use this for the Colour ADT (colourspace indexes).

This is deferred until we have user-defined datatypes
and we can define the Colour ADT.
