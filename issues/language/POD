POD
---
POD (Plain Old Data) is a small, simple collection of generic data types
that can be used to represent any kind of data. POD is used for exploratory
and creative programming, where you are more focussed on solving a problem
or expressing an artistic idea, and less focussed on software engineering,
or building a product that can be used by others. POD lets you focus on your
idea without bogging you down in low level decisions about which data structures
are more efficient for which use cases.

POD is an evolutionary descendant of JSON:
* Instead of 3 magic named values (true, false and null), POD has symbols,
  which are generalized named values, including #true, #false and #null.
* Instead of strings and arrays, "abc" and [1,2,3], as distinct data types,
  POD has a single unified ordered sequence data type, the List, and it has
  a character data type, so that a string is a list of characters.
* POD supports algebraic data, both sums and products, while JSON only
  has products. POD provides variant values to represent sums.

There are 5 POD data types:
 * Numbers
 * Characters
 * Variants (including Symbols)
 * Lists
 * Records
